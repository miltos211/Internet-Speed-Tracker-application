# Goals of the Project

This document outlines the goals for an Internet Speed Tracker application designed to measure and analyze various aspects of network performance. Here are the key metrics the application will focus on:

## 1. Jitter
- **Description**: Jitter measures the variation in time between packets arriving, caused by network congestion, timing drift, or route changes.
- **Impact**: High jitter can lead to poor performance in real-time applications such as VoIP calls and online gaming.
- **Goal**: Track and display jitter to provide valuable insights into the stability of a user's internet connection.

## 2. Packet Loss
- **Description**: Packet loss occurs when one or more packets of data traveling across a network fail to reach their destination.
- **Impact**: It can significantly affect network performance and user experience, especially in streaming and real-time communication applications.
- **Goal**: Measure and log packet loss to help users identify problems in their network.

## 3. DNS Resolution Time
- **Description**: The time it takes to resolve a domain name to an IP address using the Domain Name System (DNS).
- **Impact**: Significantly affects how quickly web resources start loading.
- **Goal**: Measure DNS resolution time to help diagnose slow website loading times not related to raw bandwidth limitations.

## 4. TCP/UDP Connection Establishment Time
- **Description**: The time it takes to establish a TCP or UDP connection.
- **Impact**: Impacts the responsiveness of various services and websites.
- **Goal**: Measure TCP/UDP connection establishment time to provide insights into the responsiveness of services.

## 5. Download Speed
- **Goal**: Measure and log the rate at which data is downloaded from the internet to the user's device.

## 6. Upload Speed
- **Goal**: Measure and log the rate at which data is uploaded from the user's device to the internet.

## 7. Ping
- **Description**: The response time of your connection—how quickly your device gets a response after you’ve sent out a request.
- **Impact**: Affects both upload and download directions.
- **Goal**: Measure and display ping times for both upload and download to assess the efficiency of the data transmission.

## 8. BBC Website Load Time Test
- **Description**: Measures the time it takes for all the data from the BBC website to be fully sent and loaded.
- **Goal**: Provide a real-world application test to measure how long it takes for a complete webpage to load under current internet speeds.

These goals aim to provide a comprehensive view of an internet connection's quality, helping users better understand and optimize their online experiences.
